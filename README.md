This is a birthday gift I crafted for Nick this summer. It's a two week treasure hunt designed to have one clue per day. Half of them are virtual and half are in real life. I worked with his family and friends to bring this to life. I also had a great deal of help from some friends I made while interning at Uber, so I cannot thank everyone who helped pull this off enough.

I mean, you simply can't compete with friends who are willing to kick off the hunt by putting the very first clue in a bottle and slipping it into the arms of the participant midway through the night.

# Quest List

## Language Decoding

In middle school, my friend Jackie introduced me to a secret language she and a friend came up with in lower school. I was pretty bored in our version of linear algebra one day, so I decided to resurrect the language. I had forgotten some of the letters, so I redesigned it hoping to stay as true to the original as possible. The clue was written in this "language."

## In the Game

I lent Nick my GBA SP for the summer. Pokemon LeafGreen. The clue is literally in the game cartriage rather than in the virtual realm of the game. 

I drew inspiration for this from a cartoon I watched when I was a kid. There was some sort of secret recipe and it was hidden IN a computer. Physically. Shame I can't remember the show.

## The Letter

I wrote a ton of letters this summer to Nick. If I had been thinking ahead, I would have put a clue in plain text in a letter in early July, but alas, I was last minute with this as per usual. I wanted to incorporate those letters into the hunt somehow though. Counting unique words in those letters is how I decided to do that.
