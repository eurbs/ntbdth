# Loopback

## Loopback 1

This is a nonsense string of words, because I'm not sure if I'm capable of creating two clues that actually make sense.

## Loopback 2

Loopback 2 is a Caesar Cypher of Loopback 1. The words remain as english words. This clue actually makes some sense in the context of the hunt

## Todos and Extensions

This is by no means perfect. There are certainly duplicates in this list. This could be avoided by having a positive shift value for the left to right and a negative shift value for right to left. However, having duplicates allows for those words that have capitals to be shifted into new words. 

In the future, I'd like to sort the list first by number of chars and then alphabetically.
