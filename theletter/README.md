# The Letter Quest

## Involves

- typing practice
- processing text

## Premise

I wrote a ton of letters this summer to Nick. If I had been thinking ahead, I would have put a clue in plain text in a letter in early July, but alas, I was last minute with this as per usual. I wanted to incorporate those letters into the hunt somehow though.

## Task

Write a program to strip all punctuation from the letter. Check for unique words. Count how many unique words there are and how many duplicates there are. 

Solution: num_unique * num_duplicates

Sometimes simple coding practice can go a long way. The most obnoxious part of this task is having to type up the letters.
