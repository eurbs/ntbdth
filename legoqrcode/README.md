# Lego QR Code

Sure, you're supposed to build with legos, but it's pretty cool to lay them out in a pattern as well. This one just happens to be a QR code when you're done.

#### Solution Ideas

1. If you have the legos required, actually build it
2. Use an online lego builder
3. Write a program that takes in the input and has the ids mapped to images of the legos
4. Color in a perfect grid excel spreadsheet
